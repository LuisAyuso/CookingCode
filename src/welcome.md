This is a book about programming in the most general way. Sometimes members of my family or close friends ask me to teach them how to program; the reasons why they want to learn remain obscure to me, but I can see that they value the skills set I have develop.
This skill set does not only let me understand this new world we live in, but it allows me to like and enjoy technology.

Is my intention with this book to ilustrate the mental process of programming, as if a caricature were. With this I hope you may be entretained as I try to describe the intrinsics of writing a computer program.
