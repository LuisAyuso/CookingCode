When cooking, there are some steps which can be described once and then used more than one time. For example: _chopping vegetables_.

#### How to chop vegetables:

1. Get a knife.
2. Get a Copping board.
3. Choose an end of the vegetable and put the sharp side of the knife in contact with it.
4. Move the knife edge 1/4 of an inch closer to the remaining vegetable. 
5. Apply pressure in the knife until a slice is created.
6. If the remaining vegetable is larger than 1/4 of an inch repeat from 4. Otherwise continue.
7. Clean the knife and the chopping board.
