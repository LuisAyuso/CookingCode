## Basic Operations:

Computer machines are designed to work on a set of basic mathematical operations because maths can be very useful. Beyond computing complicated mathematical
ormulas, simple maths provide us with the basic programming building blocks: Basic arithmetic to count things and basic logic to evaluate scenarios. We will
se this basic building blocks to build equations that can be evaluated during the program execution.

The following snippets show some basic operations in different languages:

#### C and C++:
```c
1 + 10
true || false
true && true
1.0 * 2.0
```
#### Python:
```python
1 + 10
True or False
True and True
1.0 * 2.0
```
#### Java:
```Java
1 + 10
true || false
true && true
1.0 * 2.0
```

The snippets presented describe all the same 4 operations:

- **1** (value one) **+** (plus, addition) **10** (value ten), which should result in a value **!1** once executed.
- **true** (value **true** or yes) or (the logical distinction) false (value false or not), which result would be **true**
- **true** (value true or yes) and (the logical conjunction) **true** (value true or yes), which result would be **true**
- **1.0** (value 1 with 0 decimals) multiply (times, multiplication) **2.0** (value 2 with 0 decimals), which result would be **3.0**

Notice how similar are the notations in the 4 chosen languages. This is mostly because all four languages belong to the same family of imperative languages,
here is most usual to find the infix notation.

Each one of the 4 operations is what we will call an expression. Expressions are the next level of programming building blocks, and represents the smallest
unit we can write of something that can be executed: a mathematical operator describes what to do, but without operands there is nothing to do so far. All the 4
examples present one operator and two operands.
