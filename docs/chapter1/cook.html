<p>Programming automatizes the way we solve a problem by describing this procedure and writing the description of steps in a certain language. This procedure is
called algorithm, and identifying it is one of the most time consuming tasks a programmer deals with.</p>
<p>The one thing you need to write an algorithm is... A problem. Something you can describe, and hopefully someone or something can read your description and solve
the problem. You may think that you need a computer (or even a programming language) to program, but this just not true. Good programmers were writing
extraordinary complicated programs in the Victorian era. And many of the mathematical procedures used in geometry nowadays were carefully described in Classic
Greece. This means that if you can describe precisely enough a procedure, it is a program! Although the machine which understands your description may not have
been yet invented.</p>
<p>As promised in the title of this book, we will use cooking examples. Let's sketch the first one:</p>
<p>##How to fry an egg:
No, we are not going to implement a retro science fiction robot to cook eggs, our first program will be a detailed description on how to carry out a procedure,
the frying of an egg in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a pan</li>
<li>Put some oil on it.</li>
<li>Heat up the pan.</li>
<li>Put the egg in the hot oil.</li>
<li>You may flip it, or maybe not.</li>
<li>Put a little bit of salt (please mind your health).</li>
<li>Serve the egg in a plate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this description would be good enough for anyone who has ever stepped in a kitchen. It is far from becoming a program:</p>
<a class="header" href="./chapter1/cook.html#sorry-what" id="sorry-what"><h3>Sorry, what?</h3></a>
<p>Ambiguities like &quot;flip it&quot; or a &quot;little bit of&quot; may not be understood by our cooking partner as we read the description. We will be immediately acknowledged as
our listener interrupts us by saying: pardon?</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of addressing the egg by &quot;it&quot; we may say &quot;flip the egg&quot;, and in this manner no other object in the kitchen will be flipped.</li>
<li>Instead of a little bit, we may need to be fully specific and state how much salt is a little bit. Computers have no judgment, and we need to write down our
judgment every time, if not writing a program on how to reach this judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming languages are designed to be very specific, therefore it will require that we take the effort to describe every step, and we need to do it in a very
specific fashion. This mental process is shortly internalized as we write more programs, and we will be almost immediately corrected if what we wrote can not be
understood.</p>
<p>This kind of errors are the first barrier we will face when learning a new language. In any case it is just a phase, and it will get shorter as we learn new
paradigms.</p>
<a class="header" href="./chapter1/cook.html#youve-got-to-crack-a-few-eggs-to-make-an-omelet" id="youve-got-to-crack-a-few-eggs-to-make-an-omelet"><h1>You've got to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.</h1></a>
<p>You might have realized that in our egg-cooking-algorithm we never stated to crack the egg. Is not a problem if you did not realize, since you might have the
common sense to do so. Nevertheless, computers are famous for their lack of common sense, and they are vulnerable to ignore obvious details. A program like the
one we just described would become the worst of our nightmares, since it can be understood, it can be executed but the result is not what you wanted.</p>
<p>This kind of problem is where your skills get really tested. It is virtually impossible for any tool to assist you, since the machine does not know anything
about the domain you are working on. If you would try to teach to a martian maid how to fry an egg, is most certain that she will not crack the egg, since
martian chickens are swimming mammals.</p>
<a class="header" href="./chapter1/cook.html#exercises" id="exercises"><h3>Exercises:</h3></a>
<p>The following are exercises you can do mentally. Just take a few seconds to think on every step, and try to be both precise but short in your descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to cook an omelet?</li>
<li>How to start the car engine?</li>
</ul>
