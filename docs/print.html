<p><em>by Luis Ayuso</em></p>
<p>This is a book about programming in the most general way. Sometimes members of my family or close friends ask me to teach them how to program; the reasons why they want to learn remain obscure to me, but I can see that they value the skills set I have develop.
This skill set does not only let me understand this new world we live in, but it allows me to like and enjoy technology.</p>
<p>Is my intention with this book to illustrate the mental process of programming, as if a caricature were. With this I hope you may be entertained as I try to describe the intrinsics of writing a computer program.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#introduction" id="introduction"><h1>Introduction</h1></a>
<p>This manuscript pretends to be language agnostic, and to enforce that, several different languages will be used to illustrate concepts. Far from confusing you, this is meant to highlight the most important tools that need to be considered. Then, learning the specific details of any given technology is just a matter of typing the right questions in your favorite search engine.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#why-cooking" id="why-cooking"><h2>Why cooking?</h2></a>
<p>Some day I realized that every time I explained something about programming, I always illustrate it with cooking examples. I believe than cooking and programming have many characteristics in common, but (over any other positive trait) I like cooking examples because anyone can relate to them. You do not need to be a Michelin cook to know what is an egg or a pan. Everyone is familiar with the basic steps in the kitchen, and once we move into more complicated dishes, we introduce more complexity in the form of kitchen staff, new tools and more sophisticated ingredients. Just like programming... You will see!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what-is-programming" id="what-is-programming"><h2>What is programming?</h2></a>
<p>Most people jumps into programming for many reasons, and (at some degree all of them) are valid. Nevertheless I would like to start by describing what programming can do for you, before we can find out what can you do for programming.</p>
<p>You may have hear about &quot;solving&quot;problems by using computers, and this is just plain wrong. We solve problems by applying some analytical method some guy (much more smarter than me) made up. We may even solve problems by pushing a brute force try-and-error approach over all the possible answers. Programming is the art of automatizing, getting those ideas and put them together into an automatic process that can be executed by a machine, hopefully with minimal human intervention.</p>
<p>To achieve this objective, a programmer needs to develop some skills which are common to every language, environment or problem we want to solve. That skills set requires us to learn how to Decompose, to Abstract, and Orchestrate processes from any nature.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#decompose" id="decompose"><h3>Decompose:</h3></a>
<p>To be able to decompose into steps, and structures the process we work on. Where steps are the operations we need to execute or How to do and When, while the structures mean on What are we going to do something.</p>
<p>This skill can be leaned and trained. Knowledge about the problem we work on can solve to decompose, as well as understanding the environment we work on. Learning about data structures and their properties may help us to choose the right tool for the job.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#abstract" id="abstract"><h3>Abstract:</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes, usually during Christmas dinners, someone states: Leonardo da Vinci was the last man to know about everything!. Although they may be right, it is pretty complicated (and totally unnecessary) to track down every detail of your program, as it is complicated nowadays to fully understand every phenomena in the universe. The amount of fields of human knowledge is huge! And so it is the amount of fields that contributed to nowadays computing systems.</p>
<p>Computers are vast, layered and complex systems. Many brilliant minds have been working hard to put together little pieces. Pieces which later on have been used by any other mind (brilliant or not) as building blocks of the next layer. A programmer needs to learn to abstract himself from the underlying systems, choosing when to pay attention to a given component of the system. Programmers develop the skill to ignore everything what is out of the current scope.</p>
<p>It is Just like any other process of the real world! After all, it is very unlikely that you hunt, butcher, and cook all together your own food. Although you can always go that way if you have the time.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#orchestrate" id="orchestrate"><h3>Orchestrate:</h3></a>
<p>Now that we have successfully understood the nature of the process we want to automatize, and what is in the reach of our effort is time to put some order and get the job done. We need to cope with those steps we identified by decomposing the problem, and tailor them in time so we they are executed in the correct order. Programmers need to understand timing, since in most of cases the problem is not what to do but when.</p>
<p>Most certainly the more complicated skill to grow; as we program some code and it grows fat in number of lines, the visibility we have over the big picture turns blurry and partial. This situation turns even more chaotic when more than one programmer has contributed, and it turns desperate if you have no one who to ask.</p>
<p>Orchestrating your processes in a way that they do not interfere with each other, is a must. The correctness of your solution depends on it. Orchestrating your processes in a way that they do not interfere with anyone else processes, is a desirable skill which will sometimes make you think if your are the only one sane person in the world.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#enjoy" id="enjoy"><h3>Enjoy:</h3></a>
<p>Yes, enjoy. Because code can be dirty and ugly, and the process you are working on could not be the most exciting task to do. Even in this scenarios, programming is challenging, and you can always rely in the fact that there is a different way to do (most of the cases there will be a better way to go). Measuring yourself and accepting the challenge will make you a better programmer every day, in the same manner sports do.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lets-write-some-program" id="lets-write-some-program"><h1>Let's &quot;write&quot; some &quot;program&quot;</h1></a>
<p>Programming automatizes the way we solve a problem by describing this procedure and writing the description of steps in a certain language. This procedure is
called algorithm, and identifying it is one of the most time consuming tasks a programmer deals with.</p>
<p>The one thing you need to write an algorithm is... A problem. Something you can describe, and hopefully someone or something can read your description and solve
the problem. You may think that you need a computer (or even a programming language) to program, but this just not true. Good programmers were writing
extraordinary complicated programs in the Victorian era. And many of the mathematical procedures used in geometry nowadays were carefully described in Classic
Greece. This means that if you can describe precisely enough a procedure, it is a program! Although the machine which understands your description may not have
been yet invented.</p>
<p>As promised in the title of this book, we will use cooking examples. Let's sketch the first one:</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-to-fry-an-egg" id="how-to-fry-an-egg"><h3>How to fry an egg:</h3></a>
<p>No, we are not going to implement a retro science fiction robot to cook eggs, our first program will be a detailed description on how to carry out a procedure,
the frying of an egg in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a pan</li>
<li>Put some oil on it.</li>
<li>Heat up the pan.</li>
<li>Put the egg in the hot oil.</li>
<li>You may flip it, or maybe not.</li>
<li>Put a little bit of salt (please mind your health).</li>
<li>Serve the egg in a plate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this description would be good enough for anyone who has ever stepped in a kitchen. It is far from becoming a program:</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#sorry-what" id="sorry-what"><h3>Sorry, what?</h3></a>
<p>Ambiguities like &quot;flip it&quot; or a &quot;little bit of&quot; may not be understood by our cooking partner as we read the description. We will be immediately acknowledged as
our listener interrupts us by saying: pardon?</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of addressing the egg by &quot;it&quot; we may say &quot;flip the egg&quot;, and in this manner no other object in the kitchen will be flipped.</li>
<li>Instead of a little bit, we may need to be fully specific and state how much salt is a little bit. Computers have no judgment, and we need to write down our
judgment every time, if not writing a program on how to reach this judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming languages are designed to be very specific, therefore it will require that we take the effort to describe every step, and we need to do it in a very
specific fashion. This mental process is shortly internalized as we write more programs, and we will be almost immediately corrected if what we wrote can not be
understood.</p>
<p>This kind of errors are the first barrier we will face when learning a new language. In any case it is just a phase, and it will get shorter as we learn new
paradigms.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#youve-got-to-crack-a-few-eggs-to-make-an-omelet" id="youve-got-to-crack-a-few-eggs-to-make-an-omelet"><h3>You've got to crack a few eggs to make an omelet</h3></a>
<p>You might have realized that in our egg-cooking-algorithm we never stated to crack the egg. Is not a problem if you did not realize, since you might have the
common sense to do so. Nevertheless, computers are famous for their lack of common sense, and they are vulnerable to ignore obvious details. A program like the
one we just described would become the worst of our nightmares, since it can be understood, it can be executed but the result is not what you wanted.</p>
<p>This kind of problem is where your skills get really tested. It is virtually impossible for any tool to assist you, since the machine does not know anything
about the domain you are working on. If you would try to teach to a martian maid how to fry an egg, is most certain that she will not crack the egg, since
martian chickens are swimming mammals.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#exercises" id="exercises"><h3>Exercises:</h3></a>
<p>The following are exercises you can do mentally. Just take a few seconds to think on every step, and try to be both precise but short in your descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to cook an omelet?</li>
<li>How to start the car engine?</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#baby-steps" id="baby-steps"><h1>Baby steps:</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we will start programming real computers, using as an example some common languages.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#basic-operations" id="basic-operations"><h2>Basic Operations:</h2></a>
<p>Computer machines are designed to work on a set of basic mathematical operations because maths can be very useful. Beyond computing complicated mathematical
ormulas, simple maths provide us with the basic programming building blocks: Basic arithmetic to count things and basic logic to evaluate scenarios. We will
se this basic building blocks to build equations that can be evaluated during the program execution.</p>
<p>The following snippets show some basic operations in different languages:</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#c-and-c" id="c-and-c"><h4>C and C++:</h4></a>
<pre><code class="language-c">1 + 10
true || false
true &amp;&amp; true
1.0 * 2.0
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#python" id="python"><h4>Python:</h4></a>
<pre><code class="language-python">1 + 10
True or False
True and True
1.0 * 2.0
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#java" id="java"><h4>Java:</h4></a>
<pre><code class="language-Java">1 + 10
true || false
true &amp;&amp; true
1.0 * 2.0
</code></pre>
<p>The snippets presented describe all the same 4 operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong> (value one) <strong>+</strong> (plus, addition) <strong>10</strong> (value ten), which should result in a value <strong>!1</strong> once executed.</li>
<li><strong>true</strong> (value <strong>true</strong> or yes) or (the logical distinction) false (value false or not), which result would be <strong>true</strong></li>
<li><strong>true</strong> (value true or yes) and (the logical conjunction) <strong>true</strong> (value true or yes), which result would be <strong>true</strong></li>
<li><strong>1.0</strong> (value 1 with 0 decimals) multiply (times, multiplication) <strong>2.0</strong> (value 2 with 0 decimals), which result would be <strong>3.0</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how similar are the notations in the 4 chosen languages. This is mostly because all four languages belong to the same family of imperative languages,
here is most usual to find the infix notation.</p>
<p>Each one of the 4 operations is what we will call an expression. Expressions are the next level of programming building blocks, and represents the smallest
unit we can write of something that can be executed: a mathematical operator describes what to do, but without operands there is nothing to do so far. All the 4
examples present one operator and two operands.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#where-can-i-find-my-results-variables" id="where-can-i-find-my-results-variables"><h2>Where can I find my results? Variables.</h2></a>
<p>I know that 1 plus 2 is 3, I do not really need a computer program to calculate that, so what is the point?</p>
<p>The result of an operation can be stored, so we can use it later on. From the cooking point of view this means that will get two ingredients and combine into something: I mix coffee with milk and from now on I will call it cafe late, then I pour the beverage into a cup. The cup becomes the vessel of the result of my operation (the mix) and from this point on, if I need to do anything else with the beverage I will just use the cup: instead of delivering the cafe late to the client, I will just hand over the cup.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> no cup        </th><th align="center"> Python (no variables):  </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> mix coffee and milk       </td><td align="center"> <code>1 + 2</code>    </td></tr>
<tr><td> serve coffee to client    </td><td align="center"> <code>80 * 1 + 2</code> </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th> with cup:  </th><th> Python (with variables): </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> mix coffee and milk, pour it in a cupi </td><td align="center"> <code>x = 1 + 2</code> </td></tr>
<tr><td> serve cup to client </td><td align="center"> <code>80 * x</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Notice that by using a cup, we are able to serve any kind of brewage to our customers. In the same manner, if we do not use variables in a program (although we can write a pretty big program), we would never be able to compute a different values; since we will write every operand as an specific value.</p>
<p>Variables are the way we have to store the result of computations (during program live time) and have many interesting properties (most of them common to many computer languages), although exact details on how variables work and what can you do with them are specific to the language you are learning, please check your documentation before doing assumptions.</p>
<p>And... How would this look like in any of the other languages?</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#c" id="c"><h4>C</h4></a>
<pre><code class="language-C">int x = 1 + 2;
80 * x;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the int word? This introduces us to the typing of expressions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#first-headache-types" id="first-headache-types"><h2>First headache, Types.</h2></a>
<p>No matter what you hear, every programming language is typed. The type concept is common to every language and it is there to help you out (although you might sometimes thing the opposite).</p>
<p>The kitchen can be sorted out as well along categories of tools, foods and crew members. For example: we have fruts (oranges, apples, bananas...) and we have meat (veal, pork, lamb...). When cooking a given main dish recipe, we are meant to use some kind of meat. But if instead of meat we use some fruit, then the results will be un-orthodox, leading us to a new horizon of gastronomic success or a weekend of stomachache.</p>
<p>The problem is that we did not mean the recipe to be used with fruits, and therefore results would be unexpected. In order to guarantee success with the recipe we will annotate the kind of food we want to use. Whenever to apply the restrictions or be more relaxed, depends on the cook.</p>
<p>In the same manner the cook decides whenever being more or less strict about restrictions, programming languages are more or less strict about adaptations taken to make the current values fit in place.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#python-1" id="python-1"><h4>Python</h4></a>
<pre><code class="language-Python">a = 10 # a is now an Integer number container
b = 10 + a # b is an Integer number container
c = 1.0 + a # c is a Real number container
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#c-1" id="c-1"><h4>C</h4></a>
<pre><code class="language-c">int a = 10; // a is an Integer number container
float b = 10 + a // b is a Real number container
                 // 10 + a is an Integer value
int c = 1.0 + a  // c is an Integer container
                 // 1.0 + a is a Real number value
</code></pre>
<p>The main difference between the last two snippets is that Python does not require to declare the variable type while C does. This does not mean that Python lacks of types, it means that the type of the variable will be adapted to whatever we store in it. On the other hand, in C the variable knows the type it can hold, and it will mold the value we try to fit whenever it is possible.</p>
<p>Every expression in any language has a type. Just like cooking: some broth and toppings of any kind makes a soup while some sweet dough with some icing makes a cake. Whenever you serve the cake in a pan, dish or chopping board depends on how picky the cook is.</p>
<p>Languages can be more or less type sensitive: the big picture here is that some languages like JavaScript or Python are able to infer the type of a given variable from the expression we use to initialize it, and other languages force us to write up front what kind of content this container is going to hold.</p>
<p>A word of warning: serving soup on a flat dish may turn in disaster, having appointed in the recipe to use a bowl may make life easier on the long cooks. I have experienced that strongly typed languages are more robust as the project grows, while dynamic typing is much faster (to develop and test) in the early prototyping phases. You may choose your weapon depending on the scope and resources available.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#control-flow" id="control-flow"><h2>Control Flow</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#write-down-the-steps-then-follow-them-one-at-the-time" id="write-down-the-steps-then-follow-them-one-at-the-time"><h3>Write down the steps, then follow them one at the time.</h3></a>
<p>So far we have learned how to execute arithmetic operations and somehow tailor them into an arbitrary complex equation. This could be pretty useful but so far we are very little flexible regarding options, repetitions and unexpected scenarios.</p>
<p>Let's draft a new recipe:</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-to-cook-potatoes" id="how-to-cook-potatoes"><h4>How to cook potatoes:</h4></a>
<ul>
<li>Wash potatoes</li>
<li>Cut potatoes in half</li>
<li>Salt half potatoes</li>
<li>Heat up oven 180ºC</li>
<li>Cook for 25-30 minutes. Depending on size. Check till skin becomes wrinkled.</li>
<li>Serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, I would like to acknowledge the steps enumeration. Those steps provide a temporal hint to us, and settles an order which will lead to success. Nevertheless is not the only order we can follow, as we can start heating up the oven as step 2, and then cut and salt the potatoes any time between 2 and 5. The rule of thumb here is to write something that can do the job, and we will optimize and improve the code once it is working.</p>
<p>Although we will not pay much attention to the order variations, it is important to notice the steps as individual steps. It does not matter if we can heat up the oven while we cut the potatoes. Those are two separated steps and we will try to avoid interference, otherwise we will end up turning the oven on while we hold a potato in one hand and a knife in the other.</p>
<p>In the same fashion, the code is separated in independent and self contained steps which allow us to reason about the whole procedure. These steps are the next level in programming building blocks and are called statements.</p>
<p>Each programming language may have a different definition of statements, but (once again) imperative languages share most of their features:</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#c-c-java" id="c-c-java"><h4>C, C++, Java</h4></a>
<pre><code class="language-C">int a = 1;
// this is one line comment
a = a + 1 + 12 + a * 3;
a + 1;
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#python-2" id="python-2"><h4>Python</h4></a>
<pre><code class="language-Python"># this is a line comment 
a = 1
a = a + 1 + 12 + a * 3
a + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Every expression is an statement on its own, no matter how complex turns to be. The end is marked by an end of statement token, which in case of C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Rust and others is a semi-colon ( <em>;</em> ) character, while other languages like Python use the end of line. The end of line is an invisible character that text software use to mark where a line ends and a new one begins. In other words, In Python we write one statement per line while in the _C, C++, Java, Javascript and Rust _we are allowed to write more than one (still though I may have something to say about this in the style section).</p>
<p>Statements can be grouped into sequences, which will help us to better organize ourselves. Languages like C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Rust... join statements in a group by listing them between curly braces ( <em>{</em> and <em>}</em> ). On the other hand, Python uses the indentation as groping mechanism, which is somehow controversial by easy to adopt. Nevertheless we will talk about this issue later on.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rust" id="rust"><h4>Rust</h4></a>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
{ 
    let x = 1;
    x + 1;
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#i-do-what-i-want-control-flow" id="i-do-what-i-want-control-flow"><h3>I do what I want. Control flow.</h3></a>
<p>Now that we are able to describe steps, is time to address the second and main new issue in the current recipe:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Cook for 25-30 mins. Depending on size. Check till skin becomes wrinkled&quot;</em></p>
<p>How can we do this? So far we are only able to execute one operation after another. To be able to break a series of statements and switch to other series of statements we need a common feature of imperative languages: control flow.</p>
<p>Our cook is cooking following the instructions and begins to cook the potatoes in the oven.</p>
<ol>
<li>He opens the oven and lays the potatoes inside.</li>
<li>He closes the oven.</li>
<li>He waits some time.</li>
<li>He opens the oven.</li>
<li>He checks if the skin looks wrinkled: If it does not, he goes back to point 2. Otherwise continues with 6</li>
<li>Takes the potatoes out of the oven.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 5 is slightly more complicated than other steps we have seen before. This is because it is a conditional statement.</p>
<p>There are many flavors in conditional statements and some languages may provide even more, nevertheless there are only 2 significant groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forking conditions let us choose between options, depending on the condition.</li>
<li>Loop conditions let us repeat a serie of steps, depending on the condition.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#forking-conditions" id="forking-conditions"><h4>Forking Conditions</h4></a>
<p>A forking condition enables one path of steps or another depending on a given decision:</p>
<p><em>&quot;If the potatoes are big: cut them in 4 pieces. Otherwise, cut them in half.&quot;</em></p>
<p>This condition will prepare the cook to handle two possible scenarios. Although we do not know what kind of potatoes he may find in the kitchen, our recipe is ready. With conditions we can prepare the program to evaluate the situation and act.</p>

<p>The absolute value of an integer value is the value of the digits without the sign. This means that the absolute value of 1 is 1 while the absolute valute of -1 is 1.</p>

   x = -x;

<p>When cooking, there are some steps which can be described once and then used more than one time. For example: <em>cutting vegetables</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-to-cut-vegetables" id="how-to-cut-vegetables"><h4>How to cut vegetables:</h4></a>
<ol>
<li>Get a knife.</li>
<li>Get a Copping board.</li>
<li>Choose an end of the vegetable and put the sharp side of the knife in contact with it.</li>
<li>Move the knife edge 1/4 of an inch closer to the remaining vegetable.</li>
<li>Apply pressure in the knife until a slice is created.</li>
<li>If the remaining vegetable is larger than 1/4 of an inch repeat from 4. Otherwise continue.</li>
<li>Clean the knife and the chopping board.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess no one will ever describe this process like I just did; probably using knifes in an inherent skill of the human kind. Nevertheless, this example serves us to illustrate the idea:</p>
<p>Whenever I would like to cut a carrot, pepper, or any other vegetable, I will just follow the steps described before.It does not matter what actual veggie do I need for my current recipe, and following the steps will most probably work out.</p>
<p>In a more orthodox way of phrasing it: Cutting a veggie is a function which accepts a veggie as parameter and the result is a group of slices. In a recipe you may find one instruction which states: <em>cut the carrots</em>. In our programming  languages world, this means to apply the function <em>cut</em> to the value <em>carrot</em> of type <em>veggie</em>.</p>
<p>When describing a function, there are 3 steps to keep in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>The call: When we use the function, we execute the steps it describes with an input.</li>
<li>The prototype: This &quot;thing&quot; describes how your function is named, what do we need to execute it and what will be the result.</li>
<li>The definition: The list of steps which tells us what to do.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-call" id="the-call"><h4>The call</h4></a>
<p>To use the code packed in a function, we just need to apply it to a given input.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center"> In the Kitchen  </th><th align="center"> Python </th><th align="center"> C </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center"> cut a carrot    </td><td align="center"> <code>abs(1)</code> </td><td align="center"> <code>abs(1)</code> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center"> mix soup and cream  </td><td align="center"> <code>sum(1.0, -1)</code> </td><td align="center"> <code>sum(1.0, -1)</code> </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Although using the function seems pretty similar in every language, the differences come when we want to describe their behavior.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#prototype" id="prototype"><h4>Prototype</h4></a>
<p>A very important part of a function is to give it a name, so people know what you mean by using it. When cooking, there are many <em>functions</em> available to you. You can <em>boil</em>, <em>fry</em>, <em>bake</em>, or <em>grill</em>; each of them manage to cook your food by applying heat, some other side effects may appear though.</p>
<p>A cook knows a <em>repertoire</em> of functions: like how to <em>boil</em> meat, or <em>fry</em> fish; in this way, when he writes a recipe he my skip the tedious task of explaining truisms. At the same time, the cook may want to separate the description of how to prepare the sauce from the main dish list of steps. This side story will be acknowledged in the recipe with one steps stating: <em>now you can cook the sauce</em>. By doing so we can reduce the level of detail needed, and make our recipe easier to read.</p>
<p>After the name, a list of requirements is always needed. This list will describe what needs to be provided to get the job done. In the case of <em>pealing a vegetable</em> it will be a veggie, which later on can be any kind of actual veggie: like a carrot or a potatoe. In the case of <em>mixing two liquids</em>: we will need two liquids, which can be coffee and milk, gin and tonic, or even beer and Cocacola (barbaric).</p>
<p>To finalize the prototype, we will note what is it that our operation will create: we put together some ingredients t  make a cake, or a sauce, or a soup...</p>
<p>Puting together the three parts: We have the title of our little recipe:</p>
<p><em>To boil veggies</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We will need some vegetable.</li>
<li>We will get a boiled vegetable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following examples show the prototypes for the absolute value funcion:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> C++ </th><th> Rust </th><th> Python </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center"> <code>int abs(inti value)</code> </td><td align="center"> <code>fn abs(value: i32) -&gt; i32</code> </td><td align="center"> <code>def abs(value):</code> </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Notice that python does not state what kind of value the function returns. Dynamic typing languages do not need this as they constattly addapt to the current context, as work like some kind of teenager kid who addresses everything by <em>stuff</em>. This does not mean that functions do not have a return type, it means that functions allways return some stuff, and then you can put it on a stuff container and make some other thing with this stuff.</p>
